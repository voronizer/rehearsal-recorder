# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. Versions follow [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/): until 1.0 the shape of things can still
move, though recordings on disk are never left behind — old rehearsals keep
opening.

## Unreleased

Nothing yet.

## 0.1.0

First release. Everything below already works.

### Recording

- Multitrack capture, one track per input, written to disk continuously and
  forced out every 30 seconds, so a crash costs seconds rather than a take.
- 16- or 24-bit at 44.1, 48 or 96 kHz — only the combinations the interface
  actually accepts are offered.
- A signal check before the rehearsal: open the inputs without recording and
  watch each musician land on their own track.
- The status line during a take shows the interface is alive and how much
  recording time the disk has left. If the interface disappears mid-take the
  recording stops itself and keeps what it had.
- A take interrupted by a crash is offered for recovery at the next launch.

### Listening

- Playback and mixing in Python, so the output device can be chosen and
  memory stays flat however long the take.
- Markers with a note and a kind — a plain note, "keep this", "went wrong",
  "do again" — coloured on the waveform and on the take row. They can be
  placed on the review screen before a take is even saved.
- A–B repeat, ±10 second transport, per-track volume, mute and solo, with the
  balance remembered between takes.

### Keeping and sharing

- History of every past rehearsal, read from disk.
- Renaming takes and rehearsals, folders on disk renamed to match.
- Selected takes copied to a cloud folder as WAV, FLAC or MP3 — as a stereo
  mix, as the original tracks, or both.
- Deleting is never destruction: the system Trash where there is one, a
  `_deleted` folder where there is not.

### Running it

- macOS, Windows and Linux, packaged into an app with everything inside.
- A self-test the packaged app runs on itself, so a missing native library is
  found at build time rather than at a rehearsal.
